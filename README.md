# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
## Description
The project is a simple letter guessing game. The aim of the game is to guess a randomly chosen word by inputting letters. The project helps users practice Python skills, including input validation, string manipulation, and basic game logic. By completing this project, I learned how to structure a simple Python program, handle user input, and implement basic game mechanics.

## Installation Instructions
To run the letter guessing game, follow these installation instructions
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine
2.	Navigate to the project directory
3.	Run the game script

## Usage Instructions
Once the game is running, follow these instructions to play:
1.	The program will prompt you to guess a letter.
2.	Enter a single letter when prompted.
3.	If the letter is in the secret word, the program will inform you. Otherwise, it will prompt you to try again.
4.	Continue guessing letters until you correctly guess the entire word or give up.
